/* 1️⃣ Basic Syntax of Transition
A transition consists of four main parts:

*/
selector {
  transition: property duration timing-function delay;
}
/*
property → What to animate (e.g., color, background-color, transform...)
duration → How long the animation takes (e.g., 0.5s, 1s)
timing-function → The speed curve of the animation (ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out)
delay (optional) → Time before the transition starts (0s, 1s, etc.) 
*/

/* 2️⃣ Example: Basic Transition on Background Color
This example makes the background color transition smoothly over 0.5s. */

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  margin: 50px auto;
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
}

.box:hover {
  background-color: red;
}

/* 3️⃣ Transitioning Multiple Properties
You can animate multiple CSS properties at the same time. */

.box {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: blue;
  transform: scale(1);
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease, transform 0.5s ease;
}

.box:hover {
  background-color: red;
  transform: scale(1.2); /* Enlarges the box */
}
/* 4️⃣ Understanding Timing Functions
The timing-function controls how the animation progresses:

Value	Effect
linear	Moves at a constant speed
ease	Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down (default)
ease-in	Starts slow, then speeds up
ease-out	Starts fast, then slows down
ease-in-out	Slow start and end, faster in the middle
