# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for building a Tic-Tac-Toe (X,O) game as a front-end web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game will be developed during a practice session to demonstrate front-end development concepts.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. User Interface (UI)
- **Game Board**: Display a 3x3 grid (9 cells) to represent the Tic-Tac-Toe board, styled using HTML and CSS.
- **Player Turn Indicator**: Show which player's turn it is (X or O) in a status message.
- **Reset Button**: Provide a button to reset the game to its initial state.
- **Game Status**: Display a message indicating the game outcome (e.g., "Player X wins!" or "It's a draw!").

### 2. Game Logic
- **Board State**: Store the game board as a 3x3 array (or a 9-element array for simplicity) to track cell contents.
- **Player Management**: Track the current player (X or O) and alternate turns after each valid move.
- **Move Handling**: Allow players to click a cell to place their symbol (X or O), updating the board state.
- **Cell Restriction**: Prevent clicking on a cell that already contains a symbol.
- **Win Condition**: Check for a win by detecting three identical symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
- **Draw Condition**: Check for a draw when all cells are filled with no winner.
- **Game End**: Disable further moves after a win or draw is detected.

### 3. User Interaction
- **Move Updates**: Update the board and UI after each valid move to reflect the current player's symbol.
- **Turn Display**: Update the status message after each move to show the current player's turn.
- **Result Display**: Show a win or draw message when the game concludes.
- **Game Reset**: Reset the board state, current player, and status message when the reset button is clicked.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technologies**: Use HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for game logic.
- **Compatibility**: Ensure the game works on modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
- **Code Structure**: Write modular, well-commented code with separate functions for key logic (e.g., checking win, draw, and handling moves).
- **Responsiveness**: Design the UI to be visually clear and functional on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Usability**: The game should be intuitive, with clear visual feedback for player actions.
- **Performance**: The game should respond instantly to user inputs without noticeable delays.
- **Maintainability**: The code should be easy to understand and modify, suitable for a practice session demonstration.
